Prerequisites

In the game folder when Super Yellow Gameplay Edition is put, go to this folder directories:

Graphics\Trainers
Graphics\Characters

Pokemon Trainer Sprites, Gen 4 Art Style, 
Trainer sprites are 99.9% of the time, 80 x 80 .png files, upscaled to 160 x 160. 
Your custom .png file must be 80 x 80, x1 sprite scale, that is exported to 160 x 160, 
with the export having a x2 scale on every pixel.
If your sprite design has a character who needs to be taller, such as AZ, who's x1 scale is 56 x 94,
it is up to you to figure out how to craft the dimensions your sprite conforms to.

Look at the naming structure of trainer sprites in Graphics\Trainers and Graphics\Characters to understand how to name your custom trainer sprites.
Follow this naming structure in order to prevent Pokemon Trainer character designs from conflicting with each other and overwritting each other.

Super Yellow's Pokemon Trainer Naming Convention is:

REGIONNATIONALITY/GAME/CHARACTERNAME 

Example 1: KALOIAN_XY_AUGUSTINE_SYCAMORE
Example 2: SINNOHIAN_UNOFFICAL_DPP_CLOWN
Example 3: SINNOHIAN_USUM_CYNTHIA_VACATION

Super Yellow's Overworld Character Naming Convention is:

NPC_GAME_Character_Name

Example 1: NPC_XY_Augustine_Sycamore
Example 2: NPC_UNOFFICAL_DPP_Clown 
Example 3: NPC_DPP_Cynthia

Essentials Pokemon Battle System Files

PBS\trainer_types.txt 
PBS\trainers.txt 

trainer_types.txt is where the data of every single trainer character is stored. 
Every unique trainer chracter is required to be defined in this file.

Trainer types detail: https://essentialsengine.miraheze.org/wiki/Defining_a_trainer

trainers.txt is where every Pokemon Trainer Battle you have in your game is set up,
and then can be played via Events made in RPG Maker XP, or accessed via Debug Mode.

Key Details for Super Yellow:

Effort Values go up to 256 for a single stat
512 is the Effort Value budget each legal Pokemon has to work with.
IV's are 31 100% of the time, for all generated Pokemon in Super Yellow. This means every Pokemon in the wild, the player's Pokemon and foe's Pokemon. 
Natures for opponent Trainer Battles still affect what stat is raised/lowered by 10%
To make applying a Hidden Power/Hidden Force Type easier, use the Move ID's in moves_IHPT.txt. Because IV calulators are a waste of time, and the precise values in Essentials are different from the offical games.
For the ease of making corrections, it is best to use Ability to set the Ability ID for non Mega Evolving Pokemon. 
This has the benefit of saving you hardship in trainers.txt, if you change a Pokemon's legal ability in pokemon.txt, and having to then go through trainers.txt, to make sure the species used have been updated to their new legal ability sets. 
For Mega Pokemon, do not touch the Ability or AbilityIndex values
Nicknames are 10 characters long
Shadow Pokemon are supported out of the box with Stock Essentials, and enhanced by the Deluxe Battle Kit.
Super Yellow does not have the Snag Machine or a Poke Ball designed to catch Shadow Pokemon. 
Shadow Pokemon in the context of Super Yellow, don't work in pratice, because the design goals of Shadow Pokemon serve a narrative purpose, and raising the stakes for catching a Pokemon.
Super Yellow is just Pokemon Trainer Battles, and Shadow Pokemon's mechanics cause havoc on balancing. And I personally hate how Shadow Pokemon in pratice, bring out the worst in the Catching mechanics.
Shadow Lugia serves to represent Shadow Pokemon, because I was too deep into development by the time I realised it was possible to add in Shadow Lugia, to fully inplement what was necessary to make Shadow Pokemon work in Super Yellow Gameplay Edition.

Deluxe Battle Kit Detail (Add-On Tutorials to know what to do with Battle Gimmicks): https://lucidious89-tutorials.gitbook.io/deluxe-battle-kit-tutorial

While you can use Essentials's Player tools, I recommend using Notepad++ or another good Text Editor, to reduce the tedium of setting things up.
And to have at a moment's notice be able to glance at information to know what to do.
Look at trainers.txt outside of in game to get an idea of how your custom trainer battles should be crafted.
If you want to use Deluxe Battle Kit's Mid Battle Scripting tools, you will have to have RPG Maker XP installed on your computer.

Once you are happy with the custom Pokemon battle you have made, follow these steps:

1. Press Z to open the pause menu 
2. Choose Debug
3. Choose Battle options...
4. Choose Test trainer battle/Test Trainer battle advanced
5. In Test trainer battle, simply choose what Pokemon Trainer exists. All Pokemon Trainers are sorted Alphabetially by ID. You can only do a Single Battle with this option.
6. In Super Yellow, every Pokemon Trainer has a dedicated Single and Double Battle team.
7. Use advanced to setup Double or Triple Battles. Debug Mode allows items to be used in battle. Use the Auto Win Policy item to get out of the battle.
