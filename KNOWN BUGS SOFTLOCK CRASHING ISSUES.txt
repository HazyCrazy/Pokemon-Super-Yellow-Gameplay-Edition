2.0.0 Pre Patches issues

When using the Type Matchup Lookup feature in battle,

DO NOT USE IT when a Steel type Pokemon is present.

Steel/Dragon type Pokemon, and other unknown Steel Type Combinations cause the game to softlock when viewing their matchup chart.
This issue will be fixed in future updates, if it is possible.

Calarex Ice and Shadow Rider have a diffuclt to track bug 
where they learn their Signature Moves upon Dynamxing.

When Dynamaxed by the opponent, the game softlocks.
2.0.0 Pre Patch has done the process of removing every Calarex's ability to Dynamax 
in the trainers.txt setup, that I could pick up.

This issue will be fixed in future updates, if it is possible.
