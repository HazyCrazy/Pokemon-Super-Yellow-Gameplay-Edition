Vanilla Eviolite

Line 1134

Battle::ItemEffects::DamageCalcFromTarget.add(:EVIOLITE,
  proc { |item, user, target, move, mults, power, type|
    # NOTE: Eviolite cares about whether the Pokémon itself can evolve, which
    #       means it also cares about the Pokémon's form. Some forms cannot
    #       evolve even if the species generally can, and such forms are not
    #       affected by Eviolite.
    if target.pokemon.species_data.get_evolutions(true).length > 0
      mults[:defense_multiplier] *= 1.5

Super Yellow, Make Eevium Z act as an Eviolite (Z Moves are an addon resource, so not in native Pokemon Essentials. For suitations like this, I prefer adding in the additions directly into Essentials itself)
