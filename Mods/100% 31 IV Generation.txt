Go to around Line 1195

change the following:

# @iv[s.id]       = rand(IV_STAT_LIMIT + 1)

to the following:

@iv[s.id]       = 31

If you dispise the crap that is enabled by random IV generation like I do,
use this tweak to make every Pokemon you catch not be disposable the second they are not the best stock.

If you do this and your fan game uses Hidden Power, you are going to need Independent Hidden Power Type by DemICE.
It is possible to get it working for v21.1 at a basic level.

And this is a very small tweak to EV's:

# Max total EVs (A basic optimal EV spread is now 256/252/4 or 256/256)
EV_LIMIT      = 512
# Max EVs that a single stat can have
EV_STAT_LIMIT = 256
