This is the global level up flow for all Pokemon:

Stage 1 to Stage 3 Pokemon 

Stage 1: Evolve at Level 30 
Stage 2: Evolve at Level 50
Stage 3: Fully Evolved

Stage 1 to Stage 2 Pokemon 

Stage 1: Evolve at Level 40
Stage 2: Fully Evolved 

All Pokemon with methods more complex than Level up 

Evolution Stone 
Learn a Specfic Move 

Simply put, a big reason Pokemon suffers from people having to constantly Google Wikis
comes down to how it invents highly specfic gimmicks for evolution, that are suspect to be throw away,
for another cryptic gimmick. Because Super Yellow has globally buffed every Pokemon in the game,
it is allowed to change the power curve of evolution. And it also means it can finally get rid of 
the bloated and clunky gimmicks that do nothing but result in most people not bothring with most Pokemon,
because it's not clear or too much of an arse ache to figure out how to evolve them.

And while the Universial TM's plugin has done a great job of fixing the problem,
of specfic Pokemon being held back, because they don't have a consistnet and good STAB move.
Simply put, the top of the food chain nature of Pokemon's metagame means there is 900+ Pokemon,
where all the typing, ability, Base Stat Total, Tutor, Egg and Level Up Move Pool tweaks won't amount to anything,
if a Pokemon does not have the one move it needs to be great, even if the nature of it's typing and role isn't a good fit 
for the Meta. 

So it has to be done. I have to fix the gaps in move pools so many of the worst Pokemon have.
And this work is also to put in place what needs to be done, if I ever end up making a Story Mode for Super Yellow. 
Put for now, 2.0 and 300 Trainer Battles I have tested to be working as intended is the most important thing.
