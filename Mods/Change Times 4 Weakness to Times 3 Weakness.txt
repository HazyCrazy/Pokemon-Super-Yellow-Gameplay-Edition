SUPER_EFFECTIVE               = 3 #4

SUPER_EFFECTIVE kicks in for Pokemon with a double type weakness, not for a single type weakness.
NORMAL_EFFECTIVE is for a single type weakness. DO NOT CHANGE THIS

I for my projects like setting the double weak multiplier to times 3,
because I have revamped the Base Stat Totals, type chart matchups and move pools of all Pokemon up to Gen 9.
It's up to you and your own design goals if you want double type weaknesses to be Times 4 or Times 3.
An important note: Legends Arceus uses 2.5 for a double weak Pokemon. Once again, it's up to you.
