This exists just to have this on hand.
This Python script is required, if your fan game project 
wants to revamp the metagame balance of Pokemon.
If you do not use this script, you are wasting your life.
USE. THIS. SCRIPT. 
It makes something that is infeasibly time consuming,
and can properly do the job of raising the power floor without lowering the power ceiling,
for all 1000+ Pokemon. From the trashmons to the godmons.
You still have to manually edit overtuned BST's.
This will not solve the entire picture. But it make you work smarter and not waste your life.
You have to have Python installed for this to work, but I trust you can figure that out on your own.
These .txt file are really for me to keep track of what I am changing in Essentials.
I don't expect this to be usuable for anyone who isn't familiar with Pokemon Essentials.
