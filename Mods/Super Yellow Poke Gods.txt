Poke Gods 

These are Pokemon who can learn every move in the game. Including Gimmick moves. 
They serve the purpose of the Pokedex Data Page doing it's job of allowing the 
player to look in game to know what a Move does, rather than Google it every
5 seconds, the moment they want to do anything that isn't clicking the STAB 
Attack move.
