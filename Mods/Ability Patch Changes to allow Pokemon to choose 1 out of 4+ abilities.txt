Change the Ability Patch's Item Handler code to this: (The # are the old code, if you need to revert, or don't want Pokemon to be able to choose 1 out of 4 abilities)

ItemHandlers::UseOnPokemon.add(:ABILITYCAPSULE, proc { |item, qty, pkmn, scene|
    if scene.pbConfirm(_INTL("Do you want to change {1}'s Ability?", pkmn.name))
    abils = pkmn.getAbilityList
    ability_commands = []
    abil_cmd = 0
    for i in abils
      ability_commands.push(((i[1] < 2) ? "" : "(H) ") + GameData::Ability.get(i[0]).name)
    end
    cmd= pbMessage("Which ability do you want for your PokÃ©mon?",ability_commands,0,nil,0)
    pkmn.ability = abils[cmd][0]
    end
    #if scene.pbConfirm(_INTL("Do you want to change {1}'s Ability?", pkmn.name))
    #abils = pkmn.getAbilityList
    #abil1 = nil
    #abil2 = nil
    #abils.each do |i|
      #abil1 = i[0] if i[1] == 0
      #abil2 = i[0] if i[1] == 1
    #end
    #if abil1.nil? || abil2.nil? || pkmn.hasHiddenAbility? || pkmn.isSpecies?(:ZYGARDE)
      #scene.pbDisplay(_INTL("It won't have any effect."))
      #next false
    #end
    #newabil = (pkmn.ability_index + 1) % 2
    #newabilname = GameData::Ability.get((newabil == 0) ? abil1 : abil2).name
    #pkmn.ability_index = newabil
    #pkmn.ability = nil
    #scene.pbRefresh
    #scene.pbDisplay(_INTL("{1}'s Ability changed! Its Ability is now {2}!", pkmn.name, newabilname))

Simply put, having just 1 more in the capacity of abilities a Pokemon can learn,
makes it way easier to give a Pokemon better abilities for utility, battles and that suit the Pokemon
